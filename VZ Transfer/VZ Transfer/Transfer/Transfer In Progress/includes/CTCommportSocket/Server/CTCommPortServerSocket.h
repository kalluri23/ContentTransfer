 * @brief  The server side commport socket class.
 *
 *         Server side commport socket will try to accept the comming connection after it has been initialized.
 *
 *         After connection established, it will try to first get the device list information from its client and then send its own device list to client.
 *
 *         This class will be used only in case that current device is a receiver side and using router to connect.
