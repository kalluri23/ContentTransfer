    @brief Try to open the review page for user.
 
           "action=write-review" has been added for apple store deep link. Method will open the review page directly instead of open the app page and let user click the "review" button.
    @note Everything will happen in AppStore app, so process will be exactly as same as user manually choose. It's better than the new review dialog released by Apple from iOS 10.3.x since unstability for the new API.
